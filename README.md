# scrappy-scraping 

## Overview: 
I wanted to familiarize myself with web scraping and parsing HTML code using Beautiful Soup! When you look through the various python files in this repository, 
you'll probably notice the similarities in my code... yes, this was by design, as I wanted to practice basic scraping and HTML parsing using various 
free resources! 
However, you will also see that I explored different HTML sources to scrape as well as different ways to display parsed data. 
I will elaborate on these differences in my explanations of each program below. 
I studied the following page to guide me through these scrapes: https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/#keep-practicing
